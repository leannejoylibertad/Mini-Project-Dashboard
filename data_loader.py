data_loader.py
--------------
Loads and cleans the Titanic dataset for the Streamlit dashboard.

Key cleaning decisions (and why):
  * Age missing -> impute with the median of the passenger's Pclass + Sex group.
    A single global median washes out the very signal we want to study.
  * Cabin missing 77% of the time -> drop as a string field, keep as HasCabin (0/1).
  * Embarked missing in 2 rows -> fill with the modal port ('S' / Southampton).
  * Embarked codes (C/Q/S) -> human-readable port names.
  * Engineered features: FamilySize, IsAlone, Title (from Name), AgeGroup, FareBand.
